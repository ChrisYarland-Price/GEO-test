# GEOTestRESTApi

## The Tests 

The application was created in order to demonstrate how to use sinatra as an API and how to then test that API using Ruby, RSpec and Nokogiri. 

## Running the Server
In order to run the server you will need to have Ruby installed and run a ```bundle``` command. 

You should then be able to run ```rackup``` from the main folder. 

Then from that same folder to run the tests you can use the command.
```rspec test/```

The tests should then be run.
